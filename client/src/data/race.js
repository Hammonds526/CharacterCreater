      as much as a human standing nearly two
      feet taller. Their courage and endurance
      are also easily a match for any of
      the larger folk.
      Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
      hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are
      light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
      Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually
      black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have
      red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and
      groom them carefully.`,
